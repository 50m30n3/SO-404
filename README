SO-404 v.1.2 by 50m30n3 2009-2011

SO-404 is a simple bass synthesizer using 1 oscillator and 1 filter.
The oscillator is a simple saw wave oscillator and the filter is a simple
resonant lowpass filter. You know, like that other very good and famous synth
with a similar name. Just not as good and famous.

To run the synth you need Jack and ALSA. You can set a different midi channel
by starting the program using the channel number as argument. The default
channel is zero.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#65	-	Portamento time
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#72	-	Release time
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff
CC#79	-	Filter Envelope

If two notes are played together the pitch will slide according to the
portamento time. Filter cutoff is influenced by the MIDI note velocity.
A note velocity above 100 generates an accented note where the amp EG is
replaced by the filter EG.

To compile the code you need the ALSA and Jack developement files.
